# Gene prediction in long geneless iLoci

The *P. dominula* genome assembly includes 10 stretches >350kb in length with no annotated genes.
This workflow uses AUGUSTUS to predict genes and compare their translation products to a database of known proteins to determine whether the annotation workflow missed any *bona fide* genes.
